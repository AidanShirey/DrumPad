# DrumPad
DrumPad is a web application that seeks to make testing drum patterns more accessible and easy without the ownership of any MIDI controllers. Drum controls are modeled after fighting game style hitboxes, as the ergonomic and intuitive design have a simple learning curve that promotes pick up and play utility.
